**Mapping Jones State Forest 2024**

Every year, freshmen from The Academy of Science and Technology at The Woodlands College Park High School are presented with the opportunity to conduct experiments in the nearby William Goodrich Jones State Forest.

In April 2024, I, Aniket Chakraborty, decided to do a project that maps the water and soil quality of various samples collected throughout the W. G. Jones State Forest. Data about the alkalinity and ammonia contents of water samples collected have been mapped, and the maps are stored in this repository. The purpose of this project was not just to begin mapping "pollution" in the Jones State Forest, but to eventually create a platform that allows students from the Academy to further expand the project in years to come. Not many advanced GIS maps exist for the Jones State Forest, so this project's goal was to create an easy-to-interpret and easy-to-edit compilation of maps of the contents of various chemicals in the water and soil of Jones State Forest. With this information, wildlife rangers in The Woodlands, Texas, can keep track of monthly and annual levels of contaminants and factors so that they can pinpoint regions of concern and examine unusual outcomes more efficiently.

This project is currently still a work-in-progress.
